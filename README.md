That is just plain wrong. If you would like to have your own instance of [The Wardley Maps Tool](http://wardleymaps.com/the-tool1.html), you can get it running in nearly no time. Instructions are available on a [project wiki] (https://github.com/cdaniel/wardleymapstool/wiki/Running-your-own-instance).
