The future IS predictable
=========================


Jevons Paradox
---------------
* William Stanley Jevons introduction.
* Paradox explanation.
* An exercise to look for one or two contemporal examples.

On the lookout
---------------
* an attempt to define what attributes need something to have to become 
a subject to Jevons Paradox.
* it looks like there is a gap here (weakness) in mapping , so we may 
conclude the next chapter

Domain knowledge
----------------
* domain experts are required to guess whether something is mature enough
* no consultants
* knowledge can be passes easily. Judgements require some heavily earned base.

After Jevons Paradox
--------------------
* wide adoption
* side effects
* new activities

Wonder
------
* higher level products
* something novel
* uncertainity of 'what'

Evolution
---------
* repetition of the transition from lower level systems to higher level systems
* how higher level system can become a base for another system? (From 'Genesis' 
to 'Utility'), From 'Wonder' to 'War'.
* uncertain product replacement

Value
-----
* introduction to mapping
* describing axes and dependencies
* understanding landscape
* constant change

Let it pass
-----------
* You can't stop changes.
* Your success is your worst enemy.
* New activities require new practices and new knowledge.

The game
--------
* gaining efficiency
* reducing inefficiency 

Management
----------
* management practices should reflect the evolution phase of the product
* agile vs six sigma
* maturing companies
